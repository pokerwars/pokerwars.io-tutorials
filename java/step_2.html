  <p>To let you play against poker bots from all over the world, we created pokerwars.</p>
  <p>pokerwars is none the less a platform where all poker bots can meet and play against each
    other. But how can they play? How can a bot fold? Or raise?</p>
  <h3>REST</h3>
  <p>Computers communicate over the network, so your poker bot will do. There are many ways to do
    this, but at pokerwars we chose to follow REST. REST is a set of principles that enforce how the
    machines communicate to each other. The REST operations used in pokerwars are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>GET</em>: used to ask something to a machine</li>
    <li><em>POST</em>: used to say something to a machine</li>
  </ul>
  <p>REST has some other operations too, have a read <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank">here</a>
    if you want to learn more.</p>
  <h3>Java</h3>
  <p>In this tutorial you will use <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)"
      target="_blank">Java</a>, a famous and very used programming language which follows the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming"
      target="_blank">Object Oriented (OO)</a> paradigm.</p>
  <p>Java alone would be enough, but in order to get something done fast, we will also take
    advantage of an <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_framework" target="_blank">application
      framework</a>. An application framework is a piece of software that helps you in solving some
    common programming problems faster. In our case we chose <a
        href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot">Spring Boot</a>, which gives you a lot of
    power with very few lines of code. But remember, with power comes responsability! &#128540;</p>
  <h3>Enough theory now!</h3>
  <p>Let's see some code in the next step! &#129299;</p>
