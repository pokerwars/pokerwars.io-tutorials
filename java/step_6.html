  <h3>Play - Advanced</h3>
  <p>Well done in writing the first code for Phil, your poker bot!</p>
  <p>With just few lines, you can already play pokerwars! See? It wasn't that difficult. Problem is,
    Phil is now pretty silly &#128579;. We can do much better, and give Phil some intelligence.</p>
  <p>Let's now try to make it smarter! In order to do so, we need to understand how to read the
    information of the current poker table. In order to take better decisions, we need to at least
    know what cards we have.</p>
  <p>As you see in the play method there's a as parameter. This object is populated by pokerwars
    with updated information on the table. You can navigate this object and get all the information
    you need about the table:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>your cards</li>
    <li>your chips</li>
    <li>who are the other players</li>
    <li>the other players chips</li>
    <li>the current chips</li>
    <li>what stage the game is in</li>
  </ul>
  <p>and so on. But let's keep it easy for now, and try to only use our own cards.</p>
  <p>As you see we are getting your cards for you, now try to complete the code by checking that you
    have 2 aces, and do the maximum raise you can in that case,</p>
