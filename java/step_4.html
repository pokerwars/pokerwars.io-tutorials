  <h3>Some Java code</h3>
  <p>Let's see some Java code to create Phil, your first poker bot!</p>
  <p>We need to do a couple of things to communicate via REST to pokerwars:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Expose a <em>GET</em> endpoint called <strong>ping</strong>
    </li>
    <li>Expose a <em>POST</em> endpoint called <strong>play</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Ping</h3>
  <p>pokerwars needs to know that Phil is alive and ready to play. This is the purpose of the <em>ping</em>
    endpoint! pokerwars will do a <em>GET</em> request to your bot <em>ping</em> endpoint and, if
    Phil will answer successfully, pokerwars will assume he is alive and ready to play poker.</p>
  <p>
    As you see in the code example on this page, we already built the <em>GET</em> <em>ping</em>
    endpoint for you. It's just 3 lines of code (we are pretty sure you can find which one they
    are!) and this is thanks to <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot" target="_blank">Spring
    Boot</a>, the application framework we are using. This framework does lots of the dirty job for
    us under the hood, making the code look nice and simple.</p>
  <p>Have a look at the response, can you understand how it works? We are creating an <em>ok</em>
    response, which of course means a positive response, and passing back a <em>Pong</em> object,
    which is always set to <em>true</em>.
  </p>
  <p>We are ready to write some Java code to build Phil now! Let's go in the next step to do so.</p>
  <p class="exercise">There is nothing to do yet, press Submit to validate the code, and then Next.

<!--my only concern so far is that up to the step 5 there is no interaction with the user-->
