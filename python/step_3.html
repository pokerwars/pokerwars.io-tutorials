    <h2>Bottle</h2>
    <p>
        Bottle is a fast, simple and lightweight micro web-framework for Python. We decided to use Bottle because
        of its simplicity, it allows you to work on a web application easily without having to deal with low level
        configurations and concepts. Soon we are going to show you how to define endpoints, receive data from
        a API call and call to external APIs.
