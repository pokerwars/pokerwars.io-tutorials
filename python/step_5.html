    <h2>Theory in action</h2>
    <p>
        Now, finally, we can have fun. Let's start with creating one endpoint: <em>play</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        As we figured out before, the play endpoint is invoked by pokerwars.io system sending the game information and
        it's asking for an <em>action</em> as return so it's a typical POST case.
    </p>
    <p>
        We already created the <em>notifications</em> endpoint. Starting with the bottle command to identify the type
        of endpoint <em>@post</em> followed by the URL that we want to expose. In this case the URL starts with the
        domain name <em>/pokerwars.io</em> and it's followed by the verb connected to the action.
    </p>
    <pre>@post('/pokerwars.io/notifications')</pre>
    <p class="exercise">
        Now it's your turn, You need to create your <em>play</em> endpoint following what we've learned so fa.
        Have fun!!!
