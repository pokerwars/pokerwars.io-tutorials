    <h2>Our first method</h2>
    <p>
        We are now going to add the first method with some basic logic. We start simple, with the <em>ping</em> endpoint.
        The desired behaviour is to receive a call from the pokerwars server, log it, and reply with a <em>pong</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The syntax is the following:
    </p>
    <pre>
        def method_name(parameters):
        return "hello world"
    </pre>
    <p>
        In our case, inside the method we are going to log the call using the <em>printl</em> command with the following
        message:
    </p>
    <pre>'Received ping from pokerwars.io, responding with a pong'</pre>
    <p>
        And finally the interesting part, replying back with a pong JSON content. This is how to do it
    </p>
    <pre>
        response.content_type = 'application/json'
        return {"pong": True}
    </pre>
    <p>
        Setting the content type to JSON and then invoking the <em>return</em> keyword with a the pong JSON response.
    </p>

        Now it's your turn, put together the previous steps and you would be able to proceed to the next level.
