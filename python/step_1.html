    <h1>Build the foundations</h1>
    <p>
        Are you ready to start the cool journey that would lead you to learn how to write your first python poker bot? So
        buckle up and have fun! You can switch your programming language anytime with the dropdown selector at the top
        right. Let's get started!
    </p>
    <h2>The starter projects</h2>
    <p>
        In our GitHub repository you can find starter projects for a number of languages. You are not limited to those,
        you can use any programming language you want as long as it's capable of sending and receiving HTTP requests.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our starter bot for python is <a href="https://github.com/pokerwars/pokerwars.io-starterbot-python"
                                         target="_blank">here</a>, you can take a quick look if you like.
        During this tutorial we will build that same starter bot learning the basics to then allow you to extend it as
        you wish. The sky is your limit!!!
        The aim of this session is also to explain you how pokerwars.io platform works so you can train your bot to
        interact with all the other users!!! Let the fun begin!
    </p>
    <h2>Bottle</h2>
    <p>
        Bottle is a fast, simple and lightweight micro web-framework for Python. In this session we are going to show
        you how to define endpoints, receive data from a API call, manipulate data and (very important) how to make a
        call to an external API.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you might already know from your previous python experience (or because you already checked out or starter
        bot) we need to import the <i>bottle</i> module along with the functions that we are going to use during
        this example.
        There are several interesting concepts in bottle:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Routing: Requests to function-call mapping with support for clean and dynamic URLs.</li>
        <li>Templates: Fast and pythonic built-in template engine and support for mako, jinja2 and cheetah templates.
        </li>
        <li> Utilities: Convenient access to form data, file uploads, cookies, headers and other HTTP-related
            metadata.
        </li>
        <li>Server: Built-in HTTP development server and support for paste, fapws3, bjoern, gae, cherrypy or any other
            WSGI capable HTTP server.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you want to know more about bottle you can find more information <a href="https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/"
                                                                               target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Imports</h2>
    <p>
        We want to show you all the basics steps you need to know to become the new master of pokerwars, so we need
        to start right from the first step, you need to know your imports!!!
    </p>
    <p>
        There are different way to import external libraries in python, in this case we decided to import just
        specific <i>section</i> of a <i>module</i>. To do so you have to combine the two keywords <i>from</i> and
        <i>import</i> in the following way.
    </p>
    <pre>from pokerwars import winnerBot</pre>
    <p>
        in this way you are specifying to import just the section <i>winnerBot</i> from the module <i>pokerwars</i>,
        and not the rest of the module.
    </p>
    <p class="exercise">
        Now you know what to do, on your right you can see that we already add few other imports. What you need to do
        to complete your first step is to import the sections <b><i>get, post, run, request</i></b> from the
        <b><i>bottle</i></b> module.
        And remember, enjoy the ride!!!
    </p>
