    <h1>RESTful Endpoints</h1>
    <p>
        Hey good to see you again. Now we are going to have fun with few interesting API design concept.
    </p>
    <h2>The theory</h2>
    <p>
        So API are the connections between your software and the outside world. We are going to focus on a specific
        kind of API called RESTful endpoints. REST is acronym for REpresentational State Transfer, and it's an
        architecture to build APIs based on the HTTP protocol and the concept of<em>resources</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every endpoint is defining a way to access a specific resource that is stored/managed by your service.
        The second key concept is the <em>action</em> against a resource. The actions are mapped one to one with the
        HTTP verbs:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>GET: used to read and obtain information on a specific resource</li>
        <li>POST: translate to the act of creating a new resource</li>
        <li>PUT - PATCH: both used to change the internal status of an existing resource</li>
        <li>DELETE: (yes you got it) it's to remove something.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>

    <h2>pokerwars.io engine endpoints</h2>
    <p>
        Before you start coding, you need to know which are the key points of connection with pokerwars.io engine.
        We developed a very user friendly architecture, so you just have to know about 3 points of connection:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>subscribe: it allows bots to register for a new tournament</li>
        <li>ping: used by the system to check if your bot is alive and ready to play</li>
        <li>play: the most important one. This is invoked by the system to ask to your bot what's the next action to take
        in the game</li>
        <li>notifications: this is not mandatory, but it helps your bot to have extra information on what's going on in
        the game.</li>
    </ul>
