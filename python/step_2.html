    <h2>Imports</h2>
    <p>
        We want to show you all the basics steps you need to know to become the new master of pokerwars, so we need
        to start right from the first step, you need to know your imports!!!
    </p>
    <p>
        There are different way to import external libraries in python, in this case we decided to import just
        specific <em>section</em> of a <em>module</em>. To do so you have to combine the two keywords <em>from</em> and
        <em>import</em> in the following way.
    </p>
    <pre>from pokerwars import winnerBot</pre>
    <p>
        in this way you are specifying to import just the section <em>winnerBot</em> from the module <em>pokerwars</em>,
        and not the rest of the module.
    </p>
    <p class="exercise">
        On the right you can see we already added few imports. What you need to do to complete your first step is to
        import the sections <strong><em>get, post, run, request</em></strong> from the <strong><em>bottle</em></strong>
        module. And remember, enjoy the ride!!!
