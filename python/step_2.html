    <h1>RESTful Endpoints</h1>
    <p>
        Hey good to see that you are keep going with the tutorial. In this step we are going to start to have fun
        learning some very interesting concept about API design.
    </p>
    <h2>The theory</h2>
    <p>
        So API are the point of connection between your service environment and the outside ecosystem, that can be another
        service in your domain (back-end or front-end) or someone else service that is trying to connect to yours.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the specific, we are going to explore a particular kind of API, we call them RESTful endpoints.
        REST is acronym for REpresentational State Transfer, and it's an architecture to build APIs based on the HTTP
        protocol and the concept of <i>resources</i> as main actors of the communication.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you will see soon, every endpoint is defining a way to access a specific resource that is stored or managed
        by your service. The second key concept of REST is the <i>action</i> against a specific resource.
        The actions are mapped one to one with the HTTP verbs:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>GET: is used to read and obtain information on a specific resource</li>
        <li>POST: translate to the act of creating a new resource</li>
        <li>PUT - PATCH: the are both used to change the internal status of an existing resource</li>
        <li>DELETE: (yes you got it) is to remove something.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This is enough for now, there is of course much more to know about RESTful endpoints, so if you are still thirsty
        for more knowledge follow this <a href="https://restfulapi.net/" target="_blank">link</a> for more interesting
        concepts.

    <h2>pokerwars.io engine endpoints</h2>
    <p>
        Before you start coding, you need to know which are the key points of connection with pokerwars.io engine so you
        can send and receive data from your service. We developed a very user friendly architecture, so you just have to
        know about 3 points of connection:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>subscribe: this is an endpoint that pokerwars.io is exposing to allow bots to register for a new tournament</li>
        <li>ping: this is used by the system to check if your bot is alive and ready to play</li>
        <li>play: the most important one. This is invoked by the system to ask to your bot what's the next action to take
        in the game</li>
        <li>notifications: this is not mandatory, but it helps your bot to have extra information on what's going on in
        the game.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Theory in action</h2>
    <p>
        Now, finally, we can have fun. Let's start with creating 2 endpoints: the <i>play</i> and <i>ping</i> ones.
    </p>
    <p>
        As we figured out before, the play endpoint is invoked by pokerwars.io system sending the game information and
        it's asking for an <i>action</i> as return so it's a typical POST case.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the other end, the ping endpoint is more asking for an internal status of the bot, so as we've seen in the
        theory, it's a GET endpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the example you can see that we already created the <i>notifications</i> endpoint. We start with the bottle
        command to identify the type of endpoint <i>@post</i> followed by the URL that we want to expose. In this case
        the URL starts with the domain name <i>/pokerwars.io</i> and it's followed by the verb connected to the action.
    </p>
    <pre>@post('/pokerwars.io/notifications')</pre>
    <p>
        This means that we are exposing a new POST endpoint that external services can invoke to send us notifications.
    </p>
    <p class="exercise">
        Now it's your turn, You need to create another 2 of them, <i>play</i> and <i>ping</i> following what we learned
        so far. Have fun!!!
    </p>
    <p><b>HINT: </b> create ping first and play second for the validation to pass.</p>
