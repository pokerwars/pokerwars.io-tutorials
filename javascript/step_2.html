    <h2>play</h2>
    <p>Let's look at the play function first. Here in the <i>body</i> of the request we have an object called
        <b>gameContext</b>. This contains all the information about the tournment e.g. the blinds, the turn, the cards
        on the table and the different players and ther chips and bets. It will also contain information about your own
        cards.
        <pre>
    {
        "smallBlind": 1,
        "bigBlind": 2,
        "yourCards": [
            { "rank": "deuce", "suit": "clubs" },
            { "rank": "seven", "suit": "hearts" }
        ],
        "tableCards": [
            { "rank": "ace", "suit": "clubs" },
            { "rank": "eight", "suit": "hearts" },
            { "rank": "queen", "suit": "diamonds" },
            { "rank": "three", "suit": "spades" },
            { "rank": "king", "suit": "hearts" }
        ],
        "players": [
            {
                "username": "usernameOfSmallBlindBot",
                "chips": 100,
                "pot": 20,
                "isAllIn": false,
                "hasFolded": false
            },
            {
                "username": "usernameOfbigBlindBot",
                "chips": 22,
                "pot": 10,
                "isAllIn": false,
                "hasFolded": true
            },
                {
                "username": "bot3",
                "chips": 0,
                "pot": 20,
                "isAllIn": true,
                "hasFolded": false
            },
            {
                "username": "yourUsername",
                "chips": 45,
                "pot": 10,
                "isAllIn": false,
                "hasFolded": false
            },
            ...
        }
    }
        </pre>
        With this information you will have to decide what to do next.
    </p>
    <p>Remember, the <i>play</i> endpoint will be called by the Pokerwars Engine. It will POST this data to you, and
        you must respond with your next action. We do this by returning a <i>200 OK</i> status code with a JSON payload
        that looks like this:
        <pre>
        {
            action: 'SOME_ACTION'
        }</pre>
        There a multiple actions available, check the Pokerwars <a href="http://localhost:4200/how-to-play.html#_play"
            target="_blank">documentation</a> for more information.
    </p>
    <p>In Express, we send a response by assigning a status code and a payload directly in the middleware function like
        this.
        <pre>res.status(200).send(SOME_PAYLOAD);</pre>
    </p>
    <p class="exercise">Go ahead a create a response with a payload that always do <b>'fold'</b>. Store the payload in a <i>var</i> called
        <b>nextMove</b>. HINT - In Javascript we can assign a JSON object directly to a <i>var</i> like this:
        <pre>var a = { foo: 'bar' }</pre>
    </p>
    <h2>ping</h2>
    <p>This GET request is made by the Pokerwars Engine to your poker bot endpoint whe it subscribes. It ensures that
        you are subscribing with an alive and valid bot. You will then have to replay with a <i>pong</i> payload and a
        <i>200 OK</i> status code.
        <pre>{ pong: true }</pre>
    </p>
    <p>More information can be found in the Pokerwars <a href="http://localhost:4200/how-to-play.html#_ping"
            target="_blank">documentation</a>
    </p>
    <p class="exercise">Go ahead and finish the <i>ping</i> function by sending a <i>pong</i> like the one above. Don't use an
        intermediate <i>var</i> this time.</p>
    <h2>notifications</h2>
    <p>These are optional! You decide if you want them when you subscribe. Your bot does not need to provide an API for
        these, but they can give you useful hints on what is happening during the tournament.</p>
    <p>Please do not use notifications in your poker bot logic, as they are not guaranteed to always be sent. They are
        only informative so you are aware of what your bot is doing.
    </p>
    <p>We are currently sending notifications for things like:
        <ul>
            <li>Start of a tournament</li>
            <li>End of a tournament</li>
            <li>When a tournament is cancelled for any reason</li>
            <li>When your bot replies with a wrong poker action (i.e. tries to check when someone has bet or raised
                before)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Once again, there is more information in the Pokerwars <a href="http://localhost:4200/how-to-play.html#notifications"
            target="_blank">documentation</a>, feel free to check it out.
    </p>
    <p>In this case we have created the function for you. We are just logging the notifcations in the console, but you could potentially store them or display them somewhere else.</p>
